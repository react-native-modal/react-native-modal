# react-native-modal

> If you're new to the React Native world, please notice that React Native itself offers a [<Modal /> component that works out-of-the-box](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal).

An enhanced, animated, customizable React Native modal.

The goal of `react-native-modal` is expanding the original React Native `<Modal>` component by adding animations, style customization options, and new features, while still providing a simple API.

</p>

## Features

- Smooth enter/exit animations
- Plain simple and flexible APIs
- Customizable backdrop opacity, color and timing
- Listeners for the modal animations ending
- Resize itself correctly on device rotation
- Swipeable
- Scrollable

## Setup

This library is available on npm, install it with: `npm i react-native-modal` or `yarn add react-native-modal`.

## Usage

Since `react-native-modal` is an extension of the [original React Native modal](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal.html), it works in a similar fashion.

1.  Import `react-native-modal`:

```javascript
import Modal from "react-native-modal";
```

2.  Create a `<Modal>` component and nest its content inside of it:

```javascript
function WrapperComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Modal>
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
        </View>
      </Modal>
    </View>
  );
}
```

3.  Then, show the modal by setting the `isVisible` prop to `true`:

```javascript
function WrapperComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Modal isVisible={true}>
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
        </View>
      </Modal>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The `isVisible` prop is the only prop you'll really need to make the modal work: you should control this prop value by saving it in your wrapper component state and setting it to `true` or `false` when needed.

## A complete example

The following example consists in a component (`ModalTester`) with a button and a modal.
The modal is controlled by the `isModalVisible` state variable and it is initially hidden, since its value is `false`.
Pressing the button sets `isModalVisible` to true, making the modal visible.
Inside the modal there is another button that, when pressed, sets `isModalVisible` to false, hiding the modal.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button, Text, View } from "react-native";
import Modal from "react-native-modal";

function ModalTester() {
  const [isModalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(false);

  const toggleModal = () => {
    setModalVisible(!isModalVisible);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Button title="Show modal" onPress={toggleModal} />

      <Modal isVisible={isModalVisible}>
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Text>Hello!</Text>

          <Button title="Hide modal" onPress={toggleModal} />
        </View>
      </Modal>
    </View>
  );
}

export default ModalTester;
```

For a more complex example take a look at the `/example` directory.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected

Under the hood `react-native-modal` uses react-native original [Modal component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal).
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-modal` with react-native original Modal component and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a [react-native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

### The backdrop is not completely filled/covered on some Android devices (Galaxy, for one)

React-Native has a few issues detecting the correct device width/height of some devices.
If you're experiencing this issue, you'll need to install [`react-native-extra-dimensions-android`](https://github.com/Sunhat/react-native-extra-dimensions-android).
Then, provide the real window height (obtained from `react-native-extra-dimensions-android`) to the modal:

```javascript
const deviceWidth = Dimensions.get("window").width;
const deviceHeight =
  Platform.OS === "ios"
    ? Dimensions.get("window").height
    : require("react-native-extra-dimensions-android").get(
        "REAL_WINDOW_HEIGHT"
      );

function WrapperComponent() {
  const [isModalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <Modal
      isVisible={isModalVisible}
      deviceWidth={deviceWidth}
      deviceHeight={deviceHeight}
    >
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
      </View>
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

### How can I hide the modal by pressing outside of its content?

The prop `onBackdropPress` allows you to handle this situation:

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={isModalVisible}
  onBackdropPress={() => setModalVisible(false)}
>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### How can I hide the modal by swiping it?

The prop `onSwipeComplete` allows you to handle this situation (remember to set `swipeDirection` too!):

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={isModalVisible}
  onSwipeComplete={() => setModalVisible(false)}
  swipeDirection="left"
>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

Note that when using `useNativeDriver={true}` the modal won't drag correctly. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/163#issuecomment-409760695).

### The modal flashes in a weird way when animating

Unfortunately this is a [known issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/92) that happens when `useNativeDriver=true` and must still be solved.
In the meanwhile as a workaround you can set the `hideModalContentWhileAnimating` prop to `true`: this seems to solve the issue.
Also, do not assign a `backgroundColor` property directly to the Modal. Prefer to set it on the child container.

### The modal background doesn't animate properly

Are you sure you named the `isVisible` prop correctly? Make sure it is spelled correctly: `isVisible`, not `visible`.

### The modal doesn't change orientation

Add a `supportedOrientations={['portrait', 'landscape']}` prop to the component, as described [in the React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal.html#supportedorientations).

Also, if you're providing the `deviceHeight` and `deviceWidth` props you'll have to manually update them when the layout changes.

### I can't show multiple modals one after another

Unfortunately right now react-native doesn't allow multiple modals to be displayed at the same time.
This means that, in `react-native-modal`, if you want to immediately show a new modal after closing one you must first make sure that the modal that your closing has completed its hiding animation by using the `onModalHide` prop.

### I can't show multiple modals at the same time

See the question above.
Showing multiple modals (or even alerts/dialogs) at the same time is not doable because of a react-native bug.
That said, I would strongly advice against using multiple modals at the same time because, most often than not, this leads to a bad UX, especially on mobile (just my opinion).

### The StatusBar style changes when the modal shows up

This issue has been discussed [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/50).
The TLDR is: it's a know React-Native issue with the Modal component 😞

### The modal is not covering the entire screen

The modal style applied by default has a small margin.
If you want the modal to cover the entire screen you can easily override it this way:

```js
<Modal style={{ margin: 0 }}>...</Modal>
```

### I can't scroll my ScrollView inside of the modal

Enable propagateSwipe to allow your child components to receive swipe events:

```js
<Modal propagateSwipe>...</Modal>
```

Please notice that this is still a WIP fix and might not fix your issue yet, see [issue #236](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/236).

### The modal enter/exit animation flickers

Make sure your `animationIn` and `animationOut` are set correctly.
We noticed that, for example, using `fadeIn` as an exit animation makes the modal flicker (it should be `fadeOut`!).
Also, some users have noticed that setting backdropTransitionOutTiming={0} can fix the flicker without affecting the animation.

### The custom backdrop doesn't fill the entire screen

You need to specify the size of your custom backdrop component. You can also make it expand to fill the entire screen by adding a `flex: 1` to its style:

```javascript
<Modal isVisible={isModalVisible} customBackdrop={<View style={{ flex: 1 }} />}>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### The custom backdrop doesn't dismiss the modal on press

You can provide an event handler to the custom backdrop element to dismiss the modal. The prop `onBackdropPress` is not supported for a custom backdrop.

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={isModalVisible}
  customBackdrop={
    <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={dismissModalHandler}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }} />
    </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
  }
/>
```

## Available animations

Take a look at [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) to see the dozens of animations available out-of-the-box. You can also pass in custom animation definitions and have them automatically register with react-native-animatable. For more information on creating custom animations, see the react-native-animatable [animation definition schema](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable#animation-definition-schema).
